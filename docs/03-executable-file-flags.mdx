## gateway

```bash

```

```bash
PEACE Gateway service

Usage: gateway-server.exe [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  run
          Start service
  create-config
          Create default configuration file
  help
          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --config <PATH>
          Configuration file path (Support `.yml`, `.json`, `toml`)

      --save-cfg
          Save the current parameters as a configuration file

  -M, --runtime-multi-thread
          Enable multi thread (if feature is included)

      --runtime-worker-threads <RUNTIME_WORKER_THREADS>
          Sets the number of worker threads the Runtime will use.

          This can be any number above 0 though it is advised to keep this value on the smaller side.

          The default value is the number of cores available to the system.

          When using the current_thread runtime this method has no effect.

      --runtime-thread-name <RUNTIME_THREAD_NAME>
          Sets name of threads spawned by the Runtime's thread pool.

          The default name is "tokio-runtime-worker".

      --runtime-thread-stack-size <RUNTIME_THREAD_STACK_SIZE>
          Sets the stack size (in bytes) for worker threads.

          The actual stack size may be greater than this value if the platform specifies minimal stack size.

          The default stack size for spawned threads is 2 MiB, though this particular stack size is subject to change in the future.

      --runtime-enable-io
          Enables the I/O driver.

          Doing this enables using net, process, signal, and some I/O types on the runtime.

      --runtime-enable-time
          Enables the time driver.

          Doing this enables using `tokio::time` on the runtime.

      --runtime-enable-all
          Enables both I/O and time drivers.

          Doing this is a shorthand for calling enable_io and enable_time individually. If additional components are added to Tokio in the future, enable_all will include these future components.

      --runtime-event-interval <RUNTIME_EVENT_INTERVAL>
          Sets the number of scheduler ticks after which the scheduler will poll for external events (timers, I/O, and so on). A scheduler "tick" roughly corresponds to one `poll` invocation on a task.

          By default, the event interval is `61` for all scheduler types.

          Setting the event interval determines the effective "priority" of delivering these external events (which may wake up additional tasks), compared to executing tasks that are currently ready to run. A smaller value is useful when tasks frequently spend a long time in polling, or frequently yield, which can result in overly long delays picking up I/O events. Conversely, picking up new events requires extra synchronization and syscall overhead, so if tasks generally complete their polling quickly, a higher event interval will minimize that overhead while still keeping the scheduler responsive to events.

      --runtime-global-queue-interval <RUNTIME_GLOBAL_QUEUE_INTERVAL>
          Sets the number of scheduler ticks after which the scheduler will poll the global task queue.

          A scheduler "tick" roughly corresponds to one `poll` invocation on a task.

          By default the global queue interval is:

          - `31` for the current-thread scheduler. - `61` for the multithreaded scheduler.

          Schedulers have a local queue of already-claimed tasks, and a global queue of incoming tasks. Setting the interval to a smaller value increases the fairness of the scheduler, at the cost of more synchronization overhead. That can be beneficial for prioritizing getting started on new work, especially if tasks frequently yield rather than complete or await on further I/O. Conversely, a higher value prioritizes existing work, and is a good choice when most tasks quickly complete polling.

      --runtime-max-blocking-threads <RUNTIME_MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS>
          Specifies the limit for additional threads spawned by the Runtime.

          These threads are used for blocking operations like tasks spawned through `[spawn_blocking]`. Unlike the `[worker_threads]`, they are not always active and will exit if left idle for too long. You can change this timeout duration with `[thread_keep_alive]`.

          The default value is 512.

      --runtime-thread-keep-alive <RUNTIME_THREAD_KEEP_ALIVE>
          Sets a custom timeout for a thread in the blocking pool (millis).

          By default, the timeout for a thread is set to 10 seconds. This can be overridden using .thread_keep_alive().

  -L, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          Logging level

          [default: info]

          Possible values:

          Default is no HTTP2 keepalive (None)

      --rpc-http2-keepalive-timeout <RPC_HTTP2_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT>
          Sets a timeout for receiving an acknowledgement of the keepalive ping.

          If the ping is not acknowledged within the timeout, the connection will be closed. Does nothing if http2_keep_alive_interval is disabled.

          Sets the maximum frame size to use for HTTP2.

          Passing None will do nothing.

          If not set, will default from underlying transport.

          The actual stack size may be greater than this value if the platform specifies minimal stack size.

          The default stack size for spawned threads is 2 MiB, though this particular stack size is subject to change in the future.

      --runtime-enable-io
          Enables the I/O driver.

          Doing this enables using net, process, signal, and some I/O types on the runtime.

      --runtime-enable-time
          Enables the time driver.

          Doing this enables using `tokio::time` on the runtime.

      --runtime-enable-all
          Enables both I/O and time drivers.

          Doing this is a shorthand for calling enable_io and enable_time individually. If additional components are added to Tokio in the future, enable_all will include these future components.

      --runtime-event-interval <RUNTIME_EVENT_INTERVAL>
          Sets the number of scheduler ticks after which the scheduler will poll for external events (timers, I/O, and so on). A scheduler "tick" roughly corresponds to one `poll` invocation on a task.

          By default, the event interval is `61` for all scheduler types.

          Setting the event interval determines the effective "priority" of delivering these external events (which may wake up additional tasks), compared to executing tasks that are currently ready to run. A smaller value is useful when tasks frequently spend a long time in polling, or frequently yield, which can result in overly long delays picking up I/O events. Conversely, picking up new events requires extra synchronization and syscall overhead, so if tasks generally complete their polling quickly, a higher event interval will minimize that overhead while still keeping the scheduler responsive to events.

      --runtime-global-queue-interval <RUNTIME_GLOBAL_QUEUE_INTERVAL>
          Sets the number of scheduler ticks after which the scheduler will poll the global task queue.

          A scheduler "tick" roughly corresponds to one `poll` invocation on a task.

          By default the global queue interval is:

          - `31` for the current-thread scheduler. - `61` for the multithreaded scheduler.

          Schedulers have a local queue of already-claimed tasks, and a global queue of incoming tasks. Setting the interval to a smaller value increases the fairness of the scheduler, at the cost of more synchronization overhead. That can be beneficial for prioritizing getting started on new work, especially if tasks frequently yield rather than complete or await on further I/O. Conversely, a higher value prioritizes existing work, and is a good choice when most tasks quickly complete polling.

      --runtime-max-blocking-threads <RUNTIME_MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS>
          Specifies the limit for additional threads spawned by the Runtime.

          These threads are used for blocking operations like tasks spawned through `[spawn_blocking]`. Unlike the `[worker_threads]`, they are not always active and will exit if left idle for too long. You can change this timeout duration with `[thread_keep_alive]`.

          The default value is 512.

      --runtime-thread-keep-alive <RUNTIME_THREAD_KEEP_ALIVE>
          Sets a custom timeout for a thread in the blocking pool (millis).

          By default, the timeout for a thread is set to 10 seconds. This can be overridden using .thread_keep_alive().

  -L, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          Logging level

          [default: info]

      --rpc-http2-keepalive-interval <RPC_HTTP2_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL>
          Set whether HTTP2 Ping frames are enabled on accepted connections.

          If None is specified, HTTP2 keepalive is disabled, otherwise the duration specified will be the time interval between HTTP2 Ping frames. The timeout for receiving an acknowledgement of the keepalive ping can be set with Server::http2_keepalive_timeout.

          Default is no HTTP2 keepalive (None)

      --rpc-http2-keepalive-timeout <RPC_HTTP2_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT>
          Sets a timeout for receiving an acknowledgement of the keepalive ping.

          If the ping is not acknowledged within the timeout, the connection will be closed. Does nothing if http2_keep_alive_interval is disabled.

          Default is 20 seconds.

          [default: 20]

      --rpc-initial-connection-window-size <RPC_INITIAL_CONNECTION_WINDOW_SIZE>
          Sets the max connection-level flow control for HTTP2

          Default is 65,535

          These threads are used for blocking operations like tasks spawned through `[spawn_blocking]`. Unlike the `[worker_threads]`, they are not always active and will exit if left idle for too long. You can change this timeout duration with `[thread_keep_alive]`.

          The default value is 512.

      --runtime-thread-keep-alive <RUNTIME_THREAD_KEEP_ALIVE>
          Sets a custom timeout for a thread in the blocking pool (millis).

          By default, the timeout for a thread is set to 10 seconds. This can be overridden using .thread_keep_alive().

  -L, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          Logging level

          [default: info]

          Possible values:
          - off:   Designates that trace instrumentation should be completely disabled

  -R, --rpc-reflection
          Enable reflection service

  -r, --rpc-accept-http1
          Allow this server to accept http1 requests.

          Accepting http1 requests is only useful when developing grpc-web enabled services. If this setting is set to true but services are not correctly configured to handle grpc-web requests, your server may return confusing (but correct) protocol errors.

          Default is false.

      --rpc-concurrency-limit-per-connection <RPC_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT_PER_CONNECTION>
          Set the concurrency limit applied to on requests inbound per connection

      --rpc-http2-adaptive-window <RPC_HTTP2_ADAPTIVE_WINDOW>

          [possible values: true, false]

      --rpc-http2-keepalive-interval <RPC_HTTP2_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL>
          Set whether HTTP2 Ping frames are enabled on accepted connections.

          If None is specified, HTTP2 keepalive is disabled, otherwise the duration specified will be the time interval between HTTP2 Ping frames. The timeout for receiving an acknowledgement of the keepalive ping can be set with Server::http2_keepalive_timeout.

          Default is no HTTP2 keepalive (None)

      --rpc-http2-keepalive-timeout <RPC_HTTP2_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT>
          Sets a timeout for receiving an acknowledgement of the keepalive ping.

          If the ping is not acknowledged within the timeout, the connection will be closed. Does nothing if http2_keep_alive_interval is disabled.

      --rpc-max-frame-size <RPC_MAX_FRAME_SIZE>
          Sets the maximum frame size to use for HTTP2.

          Passing None will do nothing.

          If not set, will default from underlying transport.

      --rpc-req-timeout <RPC_REQ_TIMEOUT>
          Set a timeout on for all request handlers

  -t, --tls

## signature

```bash
cargo run --bin signature-server -- --help
```

```bash
PEACE Signature service

Usage: signature-server.exe [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  run
          Start service
  create-config
          Create default configuration file
  help
          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --config <PATH>
          Configuration file path (Support `.yml`, `.json`, `toml`)

      --save-cfg
          Save the current parameters as a configuration file

  -M, --runtime-multi-thread
          Enable multi thread (if feature is included)

      --runtime-worker-threads <RUNTIME_WORKER_THREADS>
          Sets the number of worker threads the Runtime will use.

          This can be any number above 0 though it is advised to keep this value on the smaller side.

          The default value is the number of cores available to the system.

          When using the current_thread runtime this method has no effect.

      --runtime-thread-name <RUNTIME_THREAD_NAME>
          Sets name of threads spawned by the Runtime's thread pool.

          The default name is "tokio-runtime-worker".

      --runtime-thread-stack-size <RUNTIME_THREAD_STACK_SIZE>
          Sets the stack size (in bytes) for worker threads.

          The actual stack size may be greater than this value if the platform specifies minimal stack size.

          The default stack size for spawned threads is 2 MiB, though this particular stack size is subject to change in the future.

      --runtime-enable-io
          Enables the I/O driver.

          Doing this enables using net, process, signal, and some I/O types on the runtime.

      --runtime-enable-time
          Enables the time driver.

          Doing this enables using `tokio::time` on the runtime.

      --runtime-enable-all
          Enables both I/O and time drivers.

          Doing this is a shorthand for calling enable_io and enable_time individually. If additional components are added to Tokio in the future, enable_all will include these future components.

      --runtime-event-interval <RUNTIME_EVENT_INTERVAL>
          Sets the number of scheduler ticks after which the scheduler will poll for external events (timers, I/O, and so on). A scheduler "tick" roughly corresponds to one `poll` invocation on a task.

          By default, the event interval is `61` for all scheduler types.

          Setting the event interval determines the effective "priority" of delivering these external events (which may wake up additional tasks), compared to executing tasks that are currently ready to run. A smaller value is useful when tasks frequently spend a long time in polling, or frequently yield, which can result in overly long delays picking up I/O events. Conversely, picking up new events requires extra synchronization and syscall overhead, so if tasks generally complete their polling quickly, a higher event interval will minimize that overhead while still keeping the scheduler responsive to events.

      --runtime-global-queue-interval <RUNTIME_GLOBAL_QUEUE_INTERVAL>
          Sets the number of scheduler ticks after which the scheduler will poll the global task queue.

          A scheduler "tick" roughly corresponds to one `poll` invocation on a task.

          By default the global queue interval is:

          - `31` for the current-thread scheduler. - `61` for the multithreaded scheduler.

          Schedulers have a local queue of already-claimed tasks, and a global queue of incoming tasks. Setting the interval to a smaller value increases the fairness of the scheduler, at the cost of more synchronization overhead. That can be beneficial for prioritizing getting started on new work, especially if tasks frequently yield rather than complete or await on further I/O. Conversely, a higher value prioritizes existing work, and is a good choice when most tasks quickly complete polling.

      --runtime-max-blocking-threads <RUNTIME_MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS>
          Specifies the limit for additional threads spawned by the Runtime.

          These threads are used for blocking operations like tasks spawned through `[spawn_blocking]`. Unlike the `[worker_threads]`, they are not always active and will exit if left idle for too long. You can change this timeout duration with `[thread_keep_alive]`.

          The default value is 512.

      --runtime-thread-keep-alive <RUNTIME_THREAD_KEEP_ALIVE>
          Sets a custom timeout for a thread in the blocking pool (millis).

          By default, the timeout for a thread is set to 10 seconds. This can be overridden using .thread_keep_alive().

  -L, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
