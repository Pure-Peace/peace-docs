# Guide

You will start an osu! development server locally in minutes.

## Install Rust

```bash title="linux or wsl"
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

windows guide:

https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started

## Clone from github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pure-Peace/peace
cd peace
```

---

## Prepare startup

### A Database

:::info
Peace needs a **database** to store data such as user accounts, beatmaps, and scores.

There are currently three databases to choose from:

- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) (recommended)

- [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/)

- [**Sqlite**](https://sqlite.org/) (only local servers are recommended).

:::

After choosing and installing a database, you need to create a database:

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="PostgreSQL">
```

1. Log into PostgreSQL:

```bash
psql -U <username>
```

2. Create database:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE peace;
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="MySQL">
```

1. Log into MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u <username>
```

2. Create database:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE peace;
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Sqlite">
```

1. Just create a new empty file `peace` in the peace project directory.

```bash title="linux or wsl"
cd peace
vim peace
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::note
Now, we can initialize the database with `db-peace-migrate`,
which will create the table structure and some basic data:

```bash
cargo run --bin db-peace-migrate up -u <postgresql|mysql|sqlite>://<username>:<password>@<address>:<port>/peace
```

:::

Take PostgreSQL as an example:

```bash
cargo run --bin db-peace-migrate up -u postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/peace
```

:::tip
If you want to clear the test data, you can use the `db-peace-migrate down` subcommand, or delete the database directly `DROP DATABASE peace;`.

If you changed your database structure, generate new database entities with:

```bash
cargo run --bin db-cli generate entity -u postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/peace -o frame/db/src/peace/entity
```

We can create a test user like:

```bash
cargo run --bin db-peace-cli create-user -u postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/peace --username test --raw-password test --email test@emfail.com
```

:::

---

### Generate test ssl certificate

:::info
The osu! client will use https to connect to the server,
so we need to prepare some ssl certificates before starting.
:::

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Linux or Wsl">
```

```bash title="Generate cert with openssl"
./ext/self_signed_certs/generate.sh
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows">
```

1. Download and install openssl: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

2. Add the directory of the `openssl.exe` to the environment variable `path`.

```bash title="Generate cert with openssl"
./ext/self_signed_certs/generate.bat
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

This will generate `cert.cer` and `key.pem` in the current directory.

**Install ssl certificate (optional)**

If you want to start osu! on your local machine and connect to the peace server, you need to install this certificate -> `cert.cer`.

Windows guide: [installing-a-trusted-root-certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/skype-sdk/sdn/articles/installing-the-trusted-root-certificate)
(or double-click `cert.cer`, then install the certificate to the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities store**)

---

### Set hosts

:::info
We need to set some hosts for local machine,
this is to be able to use osu! `-devserver` flag to connect to the local development server.
:::

Edit hosts file

```bash title="linux or wsl"
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

```bash title="windows"
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

Add contents

```bash title="hosts"
# Add
127.0.0.1 osu.peace.local
127.0.0.1 c.peace.local
127.0.0.1 a.peace.local
127.0.0.1 peace.local
127.0.0.1 ce.peace.local
127.0.0.1 c1.peace.local
127.0.0.1 c2.peace.local
127.0.0.1 c3.peace.local
127.0.0.1 c4.peace.local
127.0.0.1 c5.peace.local
127.0.0.1 c6.peace.local
127.0.0.1 s.peace.local
127.0.0.1 i.peace.local
```

---

### Create a shortcut to `osu!.exe`

Finally, we need to create a shortcut to `osu!.exe` and set the target to:

```
<your osu path>\osu!.exe -devserver peace.local
```

Once we are ready, we proceed to start the local server.

---

## Startup

**PEACE** is a development framework that offers flexible service combinations, so you can choose how to run the services:

1. Multi-service deployment (can be deployed in a distributed environment, but requires starting multiple services)
2. Standalone instance (lightweight and can be played on a single machine)

## Multi-service deployment

### Start gateway

:::info
The **gateway** is a stateless http(s) service,
it will directly receive and process requests from osu! clients,
you can customize it and specify different processing functions for different uris.
:::

```bash title="Start gateway server"
cargo run --bin gateway-server -- --log-env-filter=tower_http=debug --tls --ssl-cert=./cert.cer --ssl-key=./key.pem --admin-endpoints --bancho-rpc-uri http://127.0.0.1:50051 --bancho-rpc-lazy-connect --bancho-state-rpc-lazy-connect
```

Now we can see some information, which means the startup is successful:

```bash
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.41s
     Running `target\debug\gateway-server.exe --log-env-filter=tower_http=debug --tls --ssl-cert=./cert.cer --ssl-key=./key.pem --force-https --admin-endpoints --bancho-rpc-uri http://127.0.0.1:50051 --bancho-rpc-lazy-connect`
2023-02-11T16:09:03.400220Z  INFO peace_gateway: bancho_rpc gRPC service: http://127.0.0.1:50051
2023-02-11T16:09:03.405255Z  INFO peace_api::components::http: >> [Swagger UI]: https://127.0.0.1:443/swagger-ui/
2023-02-11T16:09:03.405347Z  INFO peace_api::components::http: >> [openapi.json]: https://127.0.0.1:443/api-doc/openapi.json
2023-02-11T16:09:03.405842Z  INFO peace_api::components::http::tls: >> Force https enabled
2023-02-11T16:09:03.406044Z  INFO peace_api::components::http::tls: >> [HTTP SERVER] (only redirect http to https) listening on: http://127.0.0.1:8000
2023-02-11T16:09:03.417664Z  INFO peace_api::components::http::tls: >> [HTTPS SERVER] listening on: https://127.0.0.1:443
```

:::tip
Now we can access swagger ui via https://127.0.0.1:443/swagger-ui/.

After setting `--log-env-filter=tower_http=debug`,
the server will print information when receiving a request.

Since we passed in a `--admin-endpoints` flags,
there are some APIs available to the administrator (such as dynamically changing the log levels, etc.).

By default, the server will try to connect to the `bancho` service when it starts,
passing `--bancho-rpc-lazy-connect` flags will make the server not connect to `bancho` at startup.
:::

:::caution
In the production environment, please do not directly expose the service with the administrator api,
or pass `--admin-token <ADMIN_TOKEN>` to set a token for the administrator api.
:::

**View all available flags:**

```bash
cargo run --bin gateway-server -- --help
```

---

### Start bancho state service

:::info
The **bancho-state** is a stateful gRPC service that provides the ability to store bancho server state,
user sessions, bancho packets in memory, and provide rpc resources to other services.
:::

In fact, `bancho-state` should be considered as the state singleton of `bancho`.
We can deploy multiple `bancho` services in different geographical locations,
and connect them to the same `bancho-state` service through the intranet to complete the distributed deployment and improve the user's network experience.

Moreover, the server design of data and logic separation allows us to modify the logic of the game server at any time without causing loss of user sessions,
multiplayer games, and data packets, and does not require a real "restart" of the entire server.

```bash title="Start bancho state server"
cargo run --bin bancho-state-server -- --rpc-addr 127.0.0.1:12345 --rpc-reflection --rpc-admin-endpoints
```

Now we can see some information, which means the startup is successful:

```bash
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.39s
     Running `target\debug\bancho-state-server.exe --rpc-addr 127.0.0.1:12345 --rpc-reflection --rpc-admin-endpoints`
2023-02-11T16:37:06.060012Z  INFO peace_rpc::components::server: >> [gRPC SERVER] listening on: http://127.0.0.1:12345
```

:::tip
Since `--grpc-reflection` flags are passed in,
the server will provide gRPC reflection services,
you can get a list of rpc functions provided by this service through network requests or debugging tools such as postman,
which is convenient for debugging and calling services.

The `--rpc-admin-endpoints` flags will provide a set of RPC functions available to administrators (such as dynamically changing log levels, etc.).
:::

:::caution
In the production environment, please do not directly expose the gRPC service,
and pass `--rpc-admin-token <ADMIN_TOKEN>` to set a token for the administrator rpc functions.
:::

**View all available flags:**

```bash
cargo run --bin bancho-state-server -- --help
```

---

### Start bancho logic service

:::info
The **bancho** is a stateless gRPC service that contains the logic of the bancho server.
You can customize the logic of the server according to your needs.
Additionally, it requires a `bancho-state` service to store and process server state.
:::

```bash title="Start bancho logic service"
cargo run --bin bancho-server -- --bancho-state-rpc-uri http://127.0.0.1:12345 --bancho-state-rpc-lazy-connect --rpc-reflection --rpc-admin-endpoints --peace-db-url postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/peace
```

:::note
You should set `--peace-db-url` to your own database url! We have talked about it in the previous steps.
:::

Now we can see some information, which means the startup is successful:

```bash
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.40s
     Running `target\debug\bancho-server.exe --bancho-state-rpc-uri http://127.0.0.1:12345 --bancho-state-rpc-lazy-connect --rpc-reflection --rpc-admin-endpoints`
2023-02-11T17:09:50.122358Z  INFO bancho: bancho_state_rpc gRPC service: http://127.0.0.1:12345
2023-02-11T17:09:50.146280Z  INFO peace_rpc::components::server: >> [gRPC SERVER] listening on: http://127.0.0.1:50051
```

## Standalone Bancho instance

```bash title="Start bancho standalone server"
cargo run --bin bancho-standalone-server -- --log-env-filter=tower_http=debug --admin-endpoints --tls --ssl-cert=./cert.cer --ssl-key=./key.pem --peace-db-url postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/peace
```
